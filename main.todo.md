# Configs

- [ ] **wezterm** lua configs
- [ ] **qmmp** configs (they are messy, need to extract parts and then merge back)
  - [ ] or use **deadbeef** which has pretty simple config files (it crashes alot and then annoys with logs)
- [ ] xml configs for **DoubleCmd** in `~/.config/doublecmd`
- [ ] automate **khotkeys** extraction/injection
- [ ] goldendict & its dicts (steal from 'sync') + place suitable config to 'stow' (if possible)
